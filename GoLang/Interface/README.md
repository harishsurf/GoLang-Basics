## Intro

- Interfaces we essentially define a contract. If we define a type based off this interface then we are forced to implement all of the functions or methods defined within that interface type.

### Composition

- Composition can be achieved in Go is by embedding one struct type into another.

### Inheritance

- `golang` doesn't support Inheritance(is-a), but you can achieve it by embedding multiple interfaces. [See example](https://golangbot.com/interfaces-part-2/)
